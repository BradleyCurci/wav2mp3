        <h4>
            The wav2mp3 audio encoder was built with the intentions of being as simple and straight foward as possible.
            But we understand that it can be tricky at times.

        <h3>Converting Files</h3>

        <h5>
            Before any converting can take place, you must select files to convert.
            This can be done by clicking the "Select" button, and selecting any files you wish to convert.
            The program automatically filters out all items that are not .wav files, so no need to worry about messing
            up. If you do make a mistake however, you always have the ability to remove unwanted files from the list. Once you've loaded up all of the files you wish to convert, simply click the "Begin" button to run the
            program.
        </h5>

        <h3>Handling Converted Files</h3>

        <h5>
            Once your files are finished being converted, they are automatically sent to the completed files table. There, youre able to download individual files, or all of them at once.
        </h5>

        <h3>Saving Files to Google Drive</h3>

        <h5>
            Save your files to Google drive by clicking on the "Save to Google Drive" link and dragging and dropping your downloaded files.
        </h5>
